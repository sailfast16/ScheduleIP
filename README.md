# ScheduleIP
Use CPLEX Solver with JuMP to solve Scheduling Problem

## Install Instructions
1. ] add https://github.com/sailfast16/ScheduleIP 
    * Adds this github repo to Julia as a Package 
    * Same as "] add PackageName", but you have to register your package with julia to add by the Package Name
2. ] add JuMP#master
    * This should be done when you add the ScheduleIP package automatically, but I can't force it to get the newest version for some reason.

## Run the Example
*The Example Folder gets downloaded to your local julia directory* 
* In the Julia Command Prompt Run:
  * using Pkg; Pkg.dir("ScheduleIP) 
* go to the output directory to find the Example Folder and open it in atom to run
